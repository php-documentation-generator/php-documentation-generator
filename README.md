# PHP Documentation Generator

A PHP tool to generate a clean and structured documentation based on PHP documentation, and following
[Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation framework.

It has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it's organized will help you know where to look for certain
things:

* [Tutorials](docs/tutorials/README.md) take you by the hand through a series of steps to use PDG.
  Start here if it's the first time you use PDG.
* [How-to guides](docs/guides/README.md) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key
  problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how PDG works.
* [Contributing guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) explains the rules to contribute to PDG.
